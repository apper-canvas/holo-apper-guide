Instead of writing code, you simply describe what you want your app to do, how it should look, and how users should interact with it.</p><h3>How It Works</h3><p>When you write a prompt like 'Create a todo app with purple colors and smooth animations,' Apper understands your intent and generates a fully functional application with:</p><ul><li>Complete user interface</li><li>Interactive functionality</li><li>Responsive design</li><li>Modern styling</li></ul><h3>Your First Prompt</h3><p>Let's start with something simple.
